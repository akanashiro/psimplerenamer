# psimplerenamer
A pretty simple file renamer for Linux.

I wanted to write a simple file renamer extension for Nemo (similar to Dolphin's) but end up writing a standalone application in Python.
This app is supposed to be pretty simple, so it does not have many features. If you are a power user, I suggest you more powerfull applications such as Inviska, Gprename or Krename.

What does:
- Rename different files in different directories. It does preserve file extensions.
- Choose an initial sequence number.
- Add/remove files to rename.

It doesn't:
- use regular expressions. 
- add dates.

In progress now: Qt rewrite.

To-do (near future):
- Postfix/sufix sequence option.
- Possibility to use letters insted of numbers.
- Uppercase/Lowecase

Wishlist:
- Drag & Drop
