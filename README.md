# psimplerenamer
A pretty simple file renamer for Linux.

I wanted to write a simple file renamer extension for Nemo (similar to Dolphin's) but end up writing a standalone application in Python.

You will be able:
- Rename different files in different directories
- Choose an initial sequence number
- Add/remove files to rename

It will:
- Preserve file extensions
- Add sequence to the renamed files following the given order in the listbox.

It won't:
- use regular expressions. 
- add datea
This app is supposed to be pretty simple. Use gprename instead.

Todo:
- Ability to choose postfix/sufix
- Possibility to use letters insted of numbers
